Last time we took a peek at a way to represent ordered collections of items via **lists**.\n\nThis time we'll use **dictionaries** to create collections of unordered items (this is just an easy distinction - there's much more to it - but it's a good way to start wrapping your head around the subject).\n\n### In this Notebook\n\n- Creating dictionaries\n- Accessing elements of dictionaries\n- Methods of dictionaries"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dictionaries\n----\n\nDictionaries are another data type in Python that, like lists, contains multiple items. The difference is that while lists use an index to access _ordered_ items, dictionaries use 'keys' to access _unordered_ values.\n\nYou can go back to our short video that talks about dictionaries:\n\n[![The Basics](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UDNtW3sy-og/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UDNtW3sy-og?t=613)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Like lists, dictionaries are also found in other programming languages, often under a different name. For instance, Python dictionaries might be referred to elsewhere as \"maps\", \"hashes\", or \"associative arrays\").\n\nAccording to the [Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries):\n\n> It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key-value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}\n\nIn other words, dictionaries are not lists: instead of just a checklist, we now have a _key_ and a _value_. We use the key to find the value. So a generic dictionary looks like this:\n\n```python\ntheDictionary = {\n    key1: value1,\n    key2: value2,\n    key3: value3,\n    ...\n}\n```\nEach key/value _pair_ is linked by a ':', and each pair is separated by a ','. It doesn't really matter if you put everything on newlines (as we do here) or all on the same line. We're just doing it this way to make it easier to read.\n\nHere's a more useful implementation of a dictionary:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"myDict = {\n    \"key1\": \"Value 1\",\n    3: \"3rd Value\",\n    \"key2\": \"2nd Value\",\n    \"Fourth Key\": [4.0, 'Jon']\n}\nprint(myDict)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At the danger of repeating ourselves (but to make the point!): an important difference between `dictionaries` and `lists` is that dictionaries are unordered. Always remember that you have no idea where things are stored in a `dictionary` and you can't rely on indexing like you can with a `list`. From this perspective, a Python dictionary is _not_ like a real dictionary (as a real dictionary presents the keys, i.e. words, in alphabetical order). \n\nAnd notice too that every type of data can go into a dictionary: strings, integers, and floats. There's even a `list` in this dictionary (`[4.0, 'Jon']`)!

So that makes it fairly easy to avoid having the list 'blow up' by throwing an exception.\n\nIt's rather harder for a dictionary though, so that's why we have the dedicated **`get()`** method: it not only allows us to fetch the *value* associated with a *key*, it also allows us to specify a default value in case the key does not exist:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(programmers.get(\"Lady Ada\", \"Are you sure you spelled that right?\") )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"See how this works: the key doesn't exist, but unlike what happened when we asked for `myDict[99]` we don't get an exception, we get the default value specified as the _second_ input to the method `get`. \n\nSo you've learned two things here: that functions can take more than one input (this one takes both the key that we're looking for, and value to return if Python can't find the key); and that different types (or classes) of data have different methods (there's no `get` for lists)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Lists of Lists, Dictionaries of Lists, Dictionaries of Dictionaries...

The `\"geometry\"` section houses the geographic information of the feature (its location and type) and the `\"properties\"` section houses all of the descriptive information about the feature (like fields in an attribute table).
