This sequence of instructions is also called a *loop*.   \n\nThis is an extremely important and powerful concept, as it allows us to finally *automate* tasks! Remember that a fundamental feature of programmers is that they are *lazy* (refresh [Larry Wall's *\"Three Virtues\"*](www.threevirtues.com) that we saw in the first notebook!). The more you can delegate to the machine and avoid repeating boring and repetitive tasks yourself, the better!\n\nOf course, as the fantastic [Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/about/) likes to remind us, reality sometimes challenges this idea...\n![xkcd-automation](img/automation.png)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Two Ways to Iterate \n\nThe two most common ways to iterate (or repeat) a set of commands are the _while loop_ and the _for loop_. That's why in Python the words `while`, `for` (and `in`) are reserved words and you can't use them for variable names. \n\nThe video below is a nice (if slightly scary) intro to each of the approaches; you might remember them the next time you're in the gym:\n\n[![Demonstration of While and For Loops](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9AJ0uoxtdCQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AJ0uoxtdCQ)\n\n\nThe 'right' approach you use usually depends on [what sort of data structure you are iterating over](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/920645/when-to-use-while-or-the-for-in-python) and [whether we know before we start how many times we want to repeat the commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3bqzpf/python_for_loops_vs_while_loops/). That might sound a little vague at this point, but come back and have a think about it once you have a better understanding of how loops work.\n\nSo let's first see how while loops work, then we'll look at actual loops in Python."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# WHILE Loops\n\nRemember `if` statements? When the Python interpreter finds an `if` statement in your code, it checks if the specified condition evalutes to `True`. If the condition is `True` then it runs the remainder of the *indented* code block following the `if`. The 'true' block of code is only run once.\n\nUsing the `while` statement, the 'true' block is run for as long as the condition evalutes to `True`. So if the statment continues to evaluation to `True` then the block of code is run again and again and again and again... and again until some stopping condition is reached (usually the while condition becomes `False` for 'some reason').\n\nThis allows us to finally do some interesting stuff in code:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"counter = 1 # Starting condition: counter is at 1\n\nprint(\"The while loop is ready to begin.\")\n\nwhile counter <= 10: # Test the condition\n    print(\"The counter is at: \" + str(counter))\n    counter += 1 # Increment the counter\n    \nprint(\"The while loop has ended.\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If that looks confusing, don't worry! It's perfectly normal as that's your first example of *iteration*. \n\nLet's take a deeper look:\n- First, we defined a variable `counter` and we _initialised_ it with a value of 1. \n- Then we used the `while` statement to check if the value of `counter` was less than or equal to 10. \n- Since that condition evaluated to `True`, we printed the value of `counter` and then added 1 to the `counter`. \n- The indendented block of code was then run again and again by Python *until* the `while` statement returned a `False` (this happened because the value of counter went all the way to 11).\n- After that Python simply continued to execute the code outside the `while` *block* (i.e. the last line of non-indented code)\n\nThe fundamental idea is thus: *while this condition holds, repeat the instructions in the indented code block*.\n\nMany beginner programmers get confused by the fact that the value of `counter` is increasing without the code advancing to the point where in prints out 'The while loop has ended'. Remeber: we are starting the instruction from the beginning of the *while block*. So the first time that we hit it, `counter` has value of 1 because this is what we set it to _outside_ of the *while loop*. \n\nBut the _second_ time the while conditional is evaluted, `counter` has been incremented to 2 because the last line of the `while` block is `counter += 1`! So we increased its value while inside the *while block*. At the beginning of the third iteration it will have a value of 3, while at its end it will be incremented to 4. And so on...\n\n_CAVEAT_: pay attention to how you write your `while` *loops*! They can potentially run forever (for as long as the condition they are evaluating is `True`) maxing out your machine's memory. For example:\n\n```python\n# don't run this!\n# or if you do, save everything first\n# and then be prepared to stop the code execution manually \n# (usually by pressing CTRL+D or Cmd+D)\n# in the terminale/console\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Forever Loop! Yeeee!\")\n```\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### A challenge for you!\n\nComplete the code below to run a while loop that prints only odd numbers under 10.

'Inside' the odd numbers section we now have a second `if`/`else` block:\n```if i == 9:\n    ... do something if the odd number is 9...\nelse:\n    ... do something else if the odd number is not 9...\n```\n\n4.
